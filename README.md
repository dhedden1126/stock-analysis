# Stock Analysis '17 & '18

## Overview of Project
Leveraging VBA scripting to automate analysis of stock data for years 2017 and 2018

### Purpose
Gain further insight into stock performance of organizations for a two year time period and to improve investment decisions

## Analysis and Challenges
It turns out that the year of 2017 was a better performing year for the stocks analyzed
Challenges with this project included complicated loops to provide the proper analysis
This analysis shows the performance from start to end of a year, so determining volitility throughout the year doesn't show
The scope of the analysis was narrow and provided minimal insight

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Potential challenges with the analysis include the following:
- complicated and multiple loops to be written
- concluding much with the analysis was difficult due to the lack of depthness

## Summary
Overall, investors in the twelve companies analyzed, made positive returns versus 2018 and would have been better served to trim positions prior to 2018. 

Technically speaking, refactoring code assists in reducing the processing time. Which is a benefit when working with larger data sets.
The down side is the time invested to refactor previous code that worked and that may mean additional operational costs within an organization.
